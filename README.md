## Other

- I've lived in Ghana where I volunteered as a teacher and accidentally became the king of the village I lived it. 
- For a year I traveled in southeast Asia, the States, and South Africa while I was trying to build an edtech startup. It failed. That's when I realized I need to learn how to code. 
- I organized a 1000 km bike tour with my two brothers to raise awareness for sustainability. We where in the news 13 times, had 50 bikers join, including a few top politicians. 
- I joined a music group and toured a dozen countries. My highlight was a Spanish solo for 6k Mexicans. (For the record, I'm a terrible singer. I only got the opportunity because the three first options were sick.)
- I've participated in a silent retreat and taken several solo trips to remote parts of the world.
