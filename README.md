Aged 27, I am living close to Paris.

Soon to finish my current studies in school ([42Born2Code](https://www.42.fr/)).<br />
I would like to work in Rust and travel in europe.<br />
I've already worked for a company as a cook in the most famous hotels in Paris.<br />
I'm a hard worker and I'm really passionate about programming.<br />
